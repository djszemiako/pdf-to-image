# PDF to Image

Converts PDFs' pages into JPEGs.

Use of `uv` is strongly recommended. To run, use:
```sh
uv run pdf_into_images --pdf-realpath sample.pdf --output-directory .
Converted 'sample.pdf' to 2 images into path: .
Files created:
./sample.1.jpeg
./sample.2.jpeg
```

For more help, trying using `--help`:
```sh
uv run pdf_into_images --help
```
